## 8.0 Assumptions, Dependencies, and Risks

This section outlines the assumptions underlying the capacity planning framework, dependencies critical to its execution, and high-level risks to operational success.

### 8.1 Assumptions
- All AWS Direct Connect connections are configured in active-active redundancy groups (2.1).
- Automated monitoring tools (CloudWatch, Lambda, DynamoDB) are operational and accessible (6.1, 6.5).
- Business event calendars are maintained and shared with the capacity planning team (5.2.2).
- Historical utilization data (60-90 days) is available for pattern recognition (3.2).
- AWS Support and Direct Connect partners are available for escalations (9.2).
- Application teams can identify and mitigate traffic sources during spikes (6.4.2).

### 8.2 Dependencies
- **AWS Services**: CloudWatch for metrics, Lambda for automation, DynamoDB for data storage, and SNS for alerting (6.1, 7.1).
- **Network Infrastructure**: AWS Transit Gateway and VPC connectivity for traffic routing (2.2).
- **External Providers**: Managed network providers (e.g., Rackspace for US failover scenarios) for BGP adjustments (5.3.1).
- **Business Coordination**: Timely input from business units for event correlation and impact assessment (5.2.2, 6.4).
- **Monitoring Coverage**: All connections and VIFs are integrated into the automated monitoring system (6.2.1).

### 8.3 Risks
- **Unrecognized Patterns**: Novel traffic patterns may evade automated detection, leading to misclassification (5.1.3.2).
- **Automation Failures**: Lambda or CloudWatch outages could delay alert detection (6.2.1).
- **Business Misalignment**: Inaccurate or outdated business event calendars may reduce pattern correlation accuracy (5.2.2).
- **Failover Overloads**: N-1 capacity may be insufficient during unexpected multi-connection failures (5.3).
- **Cost Overruns**: Premature upgrades due to false positives in pattern recognition could increase expenses (5.4).
- **Delayed Response**: Slow coordination with external providers (e.g., AWS Support) may prolong critical spikes (6.4.2.2).

**Mitigation**: Regular validation of automation (6.6), continuous business calendar updates (5.2.2), and proactive failover testing (10.1) reduce these risks.

## 9.0 Escalation Matrix and Contacts

This section provides a structured escalation path for capacity-related incidents and operational tasks, ensuring timely resolution and clear communication.

| **Level** | **Role/Team** | **Responsibility** | **Trigger** | **Response Time** | **Contact Method** |
|-----------|---------------|--------------------|-------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Level 1** | Network Operations Center (NOC) | Initial alert response, verification, and triage (6.1.2, 6.4.1) | WARNING alerts, connection failures | 15 minutes | Internal ticketing system, email |
| **Level 2** | Senior Network Engineer | Technical analysis, pattern validation, application coordination (6.1.2, 6.4.2) | CRITICAL alerts, urgent spikes (80-90%) | 10 minutes | Phone, ticketing system |
| **Level 3** | Network Architecture Team | Redundancy design changes, system optimization (6.3.2, 6.5) | Sustained growth, recurring pattern optimization | 24 hours | Email, scheduled meetings |
| **Level 4** | IT Management/CTO | Budget approvals, executive notifications for emergencies (6.3.1, 6.4.2.3) | Extreme emergencies (>95%), upgrade decisions | 5 minutes (emergencies), 48 hours (approvals) | Phone, executive alerts |
| **External** | AWS Support | Technical issues with Direct Connect service or emergency capacity increases (6.4.2) | Critical/emergency spikes, connection failures | 15 minutes | AWS Support Portal |
| **External** | Direct Connect Partner (e.g., Rackspace) | BGP adjustments (e.g., AS-path prepend removal), cross-connect issues (5.3.1) | US failover scenarios, physical connection issues | 10 minutes | Partner-specific hotline |
| **External** | ISP/Carrier | Last-mile connectivity troubleshooting | Physical layer issues (e.g., CRC errors) | 30 minutes | Carrier support line |

**Notes**:
- Emergency contact details (e.g., phone numbers, portal links) are maintained in Appendix B (10.2).
- All escalations must be logged in the incident tracking system with timestamps and actions (6.1).
- For US-specific failover scenarios, follow 5.3.1 for Rackspace coordination.
