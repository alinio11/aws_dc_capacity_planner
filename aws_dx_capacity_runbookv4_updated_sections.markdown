# Updated Sections for AWS Direct Connect Capacity Planning Operational Runbook

## 7.3 Handoff and Coordination Procedures

This section outlines the procedures for handing off tasks between roles during capacity planning operations, ensuring seamless coordination, clear communication, and documentation to maintain continuity and accountability.

### 7.3.1 General Handoff Principles
- **Documentation Requirement**: All handoffs must be logged in the incident tracking system or pattern database, including timestamps, involved parties, current status, and next actions (per 6.1 and 7.2 Decision Authority Matrix).
- **Communication Channels**: Use predefined channels such as the internal ticketing system, email notifications, or scheduled handoff meetings (e.g., daily stand-ups for ongoing incidents).
- **Status Updates**: The receiving role must acknowledge the handoff within the specified response time (9.1.1) and provide an update within 30 minutes.
- **Escalation if Delayed**: If acknowledgment is not received, escalate to the next authority level per the Decision Authority Matrix (7.2).

### 7.3.2 Specific Handoff Procedures
- **From Cloud Security Engineering Team to Senior Cloud Security Engineer**: Occurs for escalations from WARNING alerts or initial failure validations (6.4.1). Handoff includes alert details, initial verification data, and N-1 risk calculations. Senior Cloud Security Engineer assumes technical analysis responsibility.
- **From Senior Cloud Security Engineer to Network Architecture Team**: For pattern overrides requiring infrastructure changes or sustained growth recommendations (5.1.3.2, 6.1.2). Handoff includes analysis reports, traffic source data, and proposed optimizations. Network Architecture Team reviews and validates configurations.
- **From Capacity Planning Team to Business Stakeholders**: During monthly planning or upgrade business cases (6.3.1). Handoff involves sharing predictive analytics reports and pattern correlations for validation and approval.
- **From Business Stakeholders to Senior Management**: For risk acceptance beyond 21 days or budget approvals (5.3.2, 7.2). Handoff includes business impact assessments and executive summaries.
- **Involving InfoSec Operations**: For US-specific failover handoffs (5.3.1), coordinate directly with NSPs (e.g., Rackspace) via predefined channels, with handoff logs reviewed for audit compliance.
- **Coordination with External Parties**: Handoffs to AWS Support or partners follow escalation protocols (9.0), with internal roles (e.g., Senior Cloud Security Engineer) retaining oversight.

**Expected Duration per Handoff**: 15-30 minutes, excluding complex analyses.

## 7.4 Operational Workflows

### 7.4.1 Alert Response Workflow (Levels 1-3)

This workflow details the step-by-step response to automated alerts, structured by escalation levels aligned with roles from 7.1. It ensures rapid triage, analysis, and resolution while adhering to timeframes in 9.1.1.

#### Level 1: Initial Response (Cloud Security Engineering Team)
- **Trigger**: Receipt of WARNING, CRITICAL, or PATTERN alerts (6.1.1).
- **Steps**:
  1. Acknowledge alert within 15 minutes and verify accuracy using CloudWatch dashboard (6.1.1).
  2. Assess initial pattern classification and N-1 capacity (4.1.1).
  3. If within team authority (e.g., temporary spike monitoring), document and monitor; otherwise, handoff to Level 2 (7.3.2).
  4. Log actions in alert response log (7.2).
- **Duration**: 15-30 minutes.
- **Escalation to Level 2**: If utilization exceeds warning thresholds or requires technical analysis.

#### Level 2: Technical Analysis (Senior Cloud Security Engineer)
- **Trigger**: Handoff from Level 1 or direct CRITICAL/Urgent Spike alerts (6.4.2).
- **Steps**:
  1. Review Level 1 documentation and perform detailed traffic analysis, including source identification via application coordination (6.4.2).
  2. Validate or override automated pattern classifications (6.1.2).
  3. Calculate failover risks and prepare mitigation options (e.g., traffic prioritization).
  4. If resolved (e.g., temporary spike), document closure; else, handoff to Level 3 for infrastructure changes (7.3.2).
  5. Update pattern database if new insights emerge.
- **Duration**: 30-60 minutes.
- **Escalation to Level 3**: For sustained issues requiring N-1 redesign or system optimizations.

#### Level 3: Strategic Resolution (Network Architecture Team, with Capacity Planning Team Involvement)
- **Trigger**: Handoff from Level 2 or recurring pattern identifications needing optimization (6.3.2).
- **Steps**:
  1. Review technical analysis and correlate with historical patterns/business events (5.2.2).
  2. Recommend configuration changes or upgrades, validating with Business Stakeholders (7.2).
  3. Involve Capacity Planning Team for predictive modeling if growth is indicated (6.3.1).
  4. Document recommendations and handoff to Senior Management for approvals if budget-impacting.
  5. Monitor implementation and post-resolution effectiveness.
- **Duration**: 1-4 hours, depending on complexity.
- **Further Escalation**: To Senior Management for executive approvals (9.1.2).

**Note**: For extreme emergencies (>95% utilization), bypass levels and initiate all-hands response (6.4.2.3).

### 7.4.2 Pattern Analysis and Business Correlation Workflow

This workflow expands on the Pattern Recognition Framework (5.1.3), detailing stages for analyzing utilization patterns and correlating with business events. It involves roles from 7.1 and ensures progression based on duration and risk.

#### Stage 1: Pattern Detection (Days 1-7) – Initial Assessment (Cloud Security Engineering Team and Senior Cloud Security Engineer)
- **Trigger**: Utilization exceeds Safe Max threshold (5.1.1).
- **Steps**:
  1. Cloud Security Engineering Team acknowledges and classifies as Temporary Spike if ≤7 days, monitoring for spikes (e.g., >95% for >10 min → Extreme Emergency per 5.1.4.1).
  2. Senior Cloud Security Engineer performs initial technical analysis, calculating spike metrics (4.2.1) and N-1 risks (5.3).
  3. If cause identifiable (e.g., maintenance), accept risk with enhanced monitoring; document in standard temporary spike form (5.1.3.2).
  4. Handoff to Stage 2 if persists beyond 7 days (7.3.2).
- **Duration**: Ongoing monitoring for up to 7 days.
- **Risk Tolerance**: Up to 70% utilization (5.1.2.1).

#### Stage 2: Business Correlation (Days 8-21) – Extended Analysis (Senior Cloud Security Engineer and Business Stakeholders)
- **Trigger**: Pattern persists after Stage 1.
- **Steps**:
  1. Senior Cloud Security Engineer investigates unknown causes, correlating with business calendar (5.2.2).
  2. Engage Business Stakeholders to validate against known events (e.g., deployments) and assess impact (6.4.2).
  3. If cyclical, begin recurring analysis; if growth trend, prepare upgrade evaluation (5.1.3.1).
  4. Document investigation report with business impact assessment (5.1.3.2).
  5. Seek approval for extended risk acceptance (up to 21 days) from Business Stakeholders (7.2).
  6. Handoff to Stage 3 if unresolved (7.3.2).
- **Duration**: Up to 14 days (total 21 days from trigger).
- **Risk Tolerance**: 70% utilization, with business justification.

#### Stage 3: Pattern Confirmation (Days 22-61) – Long-Term Evaluation (Capacity Planning Team and Network Architecture Team)
- **Trigger**: Persistence beyond 21 days.
- **Steps**:
  1. Capacity Planning Team (formed by Business Stakeholders and Network Architecture Team) confirms classification using 61-day growth assessment (4.2.2).
  2. If recurring, document pattern profile and optimize around it (no upgrade); if sustained growth (>50% time above threshold), initiate upgrade process (5.1.3.2).
  3. Network Architecture Team validates N-1 configurations for any changes (5.3).
  4. Correlate with business cycles and update event calendar (5.2.2).
  5. Escalate to Senior Management for approvals if >21 days risk or budget needed (7.2, 9.1.2).
- **Duration**: Up to 40 days (total 61 days).
- **Risk Tolerance**: Safe Max only for sustained growth; accept for recurring with documentation.

#### Stage 4: Resolution and Learning (Ongoing) – Closure (All Roles)
- **Trigger**: Pattern resolution or upgrade implementation.
- **Steps**:
  1. Update pattern database with outcomes and lessons learned (3.2 Phase 4).
  2. Capacity Planning Team reviews accuracy and refines thresholds (6.3.2).
  3. Business Stakeholders confirm no ongoing impact.
  4. InfoSec Operations audits logs if applicable (7.1).
- **Duration**: 24-48 hours post-resolution.

**Note**: Involve InfoSec Operations for US-specific patterns (5.3.1). All stages require documentation per 7.2.

## 9.1 Escalation Frameworks

### 9.1.1 Escalation Timeframes and Triggers (Alert-Based Escalation)

This subsection details timeframes and triggers for alert-based escalations, aligned with roles in 7.1 and workflows in 7.4.1.

| **Alert Type** | **Trigger** | **Initial Response Time (Level 1)** | **Escalation to Level 2** | **Escalation to Level 3** | **Further Escalation (Senior Management)** |
|----------------|-------------|-------------------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| WARNING (e.g., >Safe Max) | Utilization exceeds warning threshold (5.1.1) | 15 minutes (Cloud Security Engineering Team) | If persists >30 minutes or requires analysis | If technical resolution needed (>1 hour) | N/A |
| CRITICAL (e.g., 90-95% >10 min) | Sustained critical spike (5.1.4.1) | 10 minutes (Cloud Security Engineering Team) | Immediate if urgent spike (80-90%) | If infrastructure changes required | For executive notification (>20 min) |
| URGENT Spike (80-90% >15 min) | Duration-based trigger (5.1.4) | 15 minutes (Cloud Security Engineering Team) | Within 30 minutes for investigation | If mitigation insufficient (>60 min) | N/A |
| Extreme Emergency (>95% >10 min) | Imminent failure (5.1.4.1) | 5 minutes (All Levels activated) | N/A (All-hands) | N/A | Immediate (CTO-level) |
| Connection Failure | State change detected (6.4.3) | 5 minutes (Cloud Security Engineering Team) | If capacity insufficient (>10 min) | For redundancy redesign | For US failover authorization |

**Notes**: Timeframes start from alert receipt. Use handoff procedures (7.3) for transitions. External escalations (e.g., AWS Support) within 15 minutes for CRITICAL.

### 9.1.2 Pattern-Based Escalation

This subsection outlines escalations specific to pattern classifications (5.1.3), integrating with decision authorities (7.2) and stages (7.4.2).

| **Pattern Type** | **Trigger** | **Initial Escalation Level** | **Timeframe** | **Escalation Path** | **Approval/ Documentation** |
|------------------|-------------|------------------------------|---------------|---------------------|-----------------------------|
| Temporary Spike (≤7 days) | Days 1-7 above Safe Max (Stage 1) | Level 1 (Cloud Security Engineering Team) | Accept risk up to 7 days | To Level 2 if >70% or unknown cause | Risk acceptance form (Business Stakeholders) |
| Extended Event (8-21 days) | Persists after 7 days (Stage 2) | Level 2 (Senior Cloud Security Engineer) | Within 24 hours for correlation | To Level 3 for business validation; Senior Management if >21 days | Extended risk form; Business impact assessment |
| Recurring Pattern (>60 days multiple) | Cyclical detection (Stage 3) | Level 3 (Network Architecture Team) | Ongoing, review monthly | To Capacity Planning Team for optimization; Senior Management for acceptance | Pattern profile; No upgrade if optimized |
| Sustained Growth (>50% time over 60 days) | Confirmed upward trend (Stage 3) | Level 3 (Capacity Planning Team) | Initiate within 48 hours | To Business Stakeholders for case; Senior Management for budget | Business case document; Upgrade recommendation |
| Unclear/Unknown Pattern (>21 days) | No classification after Stage 2 | Level 2 to Level 3 | Conservative approach within 24 hours | To Senior Management for risk authorization | Executive risk form; Pattern log |

**Notes**: Escalations for US patterns involve InfoSec Operations (5.3.1). Track via pattern database; escalate to Senior Management for extraordinary risks (>21 days without resolution).
