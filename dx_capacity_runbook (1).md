## 5.0 Capacity Planning Thresholds and Triggers

### 5.1 Utilization Threshold Matrix

| **Connection Speed** | **Warning Threshold** | **Critical Threshold** | **Upgrade Trigger** |
|---------------------|----------------------|----------------------|-------------------|
| 1 Gbps              | 60%                  | 80%                  | 70% for 20% of time over 7 days |
| 10 Gbps             | 65%                  | 80%                  | 75% for 15% of time over 7 days |
| 100 Gbps            | 70%                  | 85%                  | 80% for 10% of time over 7 days |
| 400 Gbps            | 70%                  | 85%                  | 80% for 10% of time over 7 days |

### 5.2 Threshold Rationale

#### 5.2.1 80% Critical Threshold Justification
Based on queueing theory and industry best practices, network utilization above 80% results in exponential growth in latency and packet queuing. This threshold provides:
- Sufficient headroom for traffic bursts
- Tolerance for BGP convergence during failover scenarios
- Buffer capacity during maintenance windows

#### 5.2.2 Time-Based Triggers
The "X% for Y% of time" methodology prevents false alarms from temporary spikes while ensuring persistent capacity issues trigger upgrades. The percentage of time varies by connection speed to account for:
- Higher speeds having more burst tolerance
- Cost implications of unnecessary upgrades
- Lead times for capacity procurement

### 5.3 Special Consideration Thresholds

#### 5.3.1 Redundancy Scenarios
- **Single Connection**: Apply standard thresholds
- **Dual Connection**: Apply thresholds assuming 50% traffic shift during failover
- **Multi-Connection**: Model N-1 redundancy scenarios

#### 5.3.2 Application-Specific Thresholds
- **Real-time Applications**: Lower thresholds (60% warning, 70% critical)
- **Batch Processing**: Higher tolerance acceptable (75% warning, 90% critical)
- **Mission-Critical Systems**: Enhanced monitoring with 50% warning threshold

#### Understanding the Monitoring Interval Design Philosophy

The different monitoring intervals for various connection speeds reflect sophisticated principles of monitoring system design that balance detection sensitivity with operational efficiency. These intervals are not arbitrary choices but represent careful consideration of how network behavior, business impact, and monitoring economics scale with connection capacity.

Think of monitoring intervals like the refresh rate of instruments in different types of vehicles. A bicycle speedometer might update every few seconds because bicycle speeds change gradually and the consequences of speed changes are manageable. A Formula 1 race car needs split-second feedback because speeds change rapidly and the consequences of delayed detection can be catastrophic. The same principle applies to network connections, where the "speed" we monitor is the rate at which utilization can change and the business impact of those changes.

#### The Mathematics of Change Detection

Understanding why higher-capacity connections require more frequent monitoring begins with examining how quickly utilization can change in absolute terms. When a 1 Gbps connection operates at 60% utilization, it uses 600 Mbps of capacity. If traffic suddenly increases by 200 Mbps, utilization jumps to 80%, crossing into warning thresholds. This represents a significant percentage change that typically reflects sustained changes in application behavior or business processes, making it likely to persist for several minutes.

Consider a 100 Gbps connection operating at the same 60% utilization level, which represents 60 Gbps of active traffic. If traffic increases by 20 Gbps (twenty times larger than the previous example in absolute terms), utilization increases to 80%. The crucial difference lies in how rapidly this 20 Gbps increase can occur. Large-capacity connections aggregate many traffic flows, and substantial absolute changes can happen quickly due to data replication activities, application deployments, or the convergence of multiple business processes.

The mathematical principle here demonstrates that absolute change capacity scales with connection speed, while percentage thresholds remain constant. Higher-capacity connections can experience larger absolute changes in shorter time periods, requiring more frequent monitoring to detect threshold crossings before they become critical operational issues.

#### Business Impact Scaling and Response Requirements

The business implications of capacity exhaustion scale dramatically with connection size, creating different urgency requirements for detection and response. When a 1 Gbps connection becomes congested, performance degradation might affect a specific application or user group. While certainly problematic, the impact radius remains relatively contained, and response teams have time to investigate, coordinate with application teams, and implement solutions.

When a 100 Gbps connection approaches capacity limits, you potentially affect dozens or hundreds of applications simultaneously, impacting thousands of users and disrupting critical business processes. The business cost of delayed detection scales exponentially with connection capacity. This situation resembles the difference between a local power outage affecting a single building versus a regional grid failure affecting an entire metropolitan area. Both require response, but urgency and resource allocation for detection scale with potential impact.

This scaling effect justifies investing in more frequent monitoring for high-capacity connections because the cost of additional monitoring operations becomes negligible compared to the business cost of delayed capacity problem detection.

#### Statistical Properties and Signal Characterization

Higher-capacity connections exhibit different statistical properties that affect optimal monitoring strategies. A 1 Gbps connection typically carries traffic from fewer applications with more predictable patterns. Traffic variations tend to be smaller in absolute terms and more predictable in timing, making five-minute monitoring intervals sufficient to detect meaningful changes while avoiding false alarms from minor variations.

A 100 Gbps connection carries traffic from numerous applications, multiple business units, and various data flow types including real-time applications, batch processing, and data replication. The traffic patterns become more complex and can change rapidly due to the diversity of contributing sources. The statistical principle involved here requires higher sampling frequencies to accurately characterize behavior, similar to how high-frequency audio signals require higher sampling rates for accurate measurement.

The signal-to-noise ratio also changes with connection capacity. Higher-capacity connections often show more stable utilization patterns as a percentage of total capacity because individual application changes represent smaller relative impacts. However, the absolute magnitude of changes can be much larger, requiring more sensitive detection mechanisms to identify significant trends before they become critical issues.

#### Detection Speed Requirements and Operational Response

Response time requirements scale with both the potential rate of change and the business impact of capacity issues. If a 1 Gbps connection shows concerning utilization trends, operations teams typically have time to investigate root causes, coordinate with application teams, and plan appropriate responses. The limited absolute capacity means that even growing utilization provides buffer time for coordinated response before reaching critical thresholds.

A 100 Gbps connection approaching capacity represents a much more urgent operational scenario. The absolute scale of traffic means conditions can deteriorate rapidly, potentially affecting multiple critical applications simultaneously. Faster detection enables response times that match the urgency of the situation, allowing operations teams to implement traffic shaping, coordinate emergency capacity increases, or activate disaster recovery procedures before widespread application impact occurs.

This principle mirrors medical monitoring approaches where routine patient monitoring might occur every few minutes during recovery, but intensive care or surgical procedures require continuous real-time monitoring because conditions can change rapidly and delayed detection consequences become severe.

#### Resource Optimization and Monitoring Economics

The question naturally arises why we do not use one-minute intervals for all connections if faster detection provides operational benefits. This brings us to fundamental principles in monitoring system design about balancing detection sensitivity with resource efficiency and cost management.

Every monitoring operation consumes resources including API calls to CloudWatch, Lambda execution time, DynamoDB storage operations, and CloudWatch metric collection. For a 1 Gbps connection where traffic patterns change relatively slowly, checking every minute instead of every five minutes increases monitoring costs by five times while providing minimal additional operational benefit. The mathematical relationship between monitoring frequency and cost is linear, while the operational benefit follows a logarithmic curve with diminishing returns.

Think of this resource allocation like security patrol scheduling. A small office building might need security checks every few hours because threats develop slowly and the value at risk is moderate. A major financial institution requires continuous monitoring because threats can materialize rapidly and the value at risk justifies higher security costs. Security needs scale with both asset value and threat development speed.

#### Practical Implementation and AWS Service Alignment

The monitoring interval selections also reflect practical AWS service capabilities and cost optimization strategies. CloudWatch metrics are collected at five-minute intervals by default for most services, making five-minute monitoring intervals natural and cost-effective for lower-capacity connections. This alignment with AWS service defaults minimizes additional charges while providing adequate monitoring resolution.

For high-capacity connections where faster detection justifies additional costs, one-minute intervals align with CloudWatch's detailed monitoring capabilities while providing significantly improved detection sensitivity. The cost increase for detailed monitoring becomes proportionally smaller compared to the business value and risk mitigation provided by faster problem detection.

#### Concrete Examples for Understanding

Consider these real-world scenarios that illustrate how monitoring interval principles apply in practice:

Connection Scenario A involves a 10 Gbps connection serving a specific application cluster, monitored every five minutes. During normal operations, utilization varies between 30% and 60% following predictable business hours patterns. If utilization suddenly jumps to 75%, this likely represents a sustained change such as a new application deployment or increased user activity that will persist for multiple monitoring cycles. The five-minute detection delay provides adequate response time for investigation and coordination without emergency pressure.

Connection Scenario B involves a 100 Gbps connection serving as a primary data center interconnect, monitored every minute. Normal utilization varies between 40% and 70% but can change rapidly due to data replication jobs, disaster recovery testing, or multiple simultaneous application deployments. If utilization jumps to 80%, this change might accelerate quickly to 90% or beyond as additional traffic flows converge on the connection. One-minute detection enables rapid response including traffic prioritization, emergency capacity activation, or coordination with multiple application teams before widespread impact occurs.

#### Building Intuitive Understanding Through Mental Models

To develop intuitive understanding of these monitoring principles, consider the relationship between system capacity, change velocity, and impact scope. Small systems change slowly and affect limited scope, making periodic monitoring sufficient. Large systems can change rapidly and affect broad scope, requiring continuous attention.

This relationship appears throughout infrastructure management, from database connection pool monitoring to application server health checks to storage system capacity planning. The fundamental principle remains constant while specific implementation details adapt to the characteristics of each system type.

Understanding this principle enables you to design monitoring strategies that provide appropriate detection capabilities while managing monitoring overhead effectively, whether applied to network capacity planning, database performance monitoring, application health checking, or security event detection.

#### Design Validation Through Operational Experience

These monitoring intervals represent practical applications of monitoring theory validated through operational experience across many network environments. The specific interval selections balance theoretical optimization with real-world constraints including AWS service capabilities, cost considerations, and operational team response capabilities.

As your Direct Connect infrastructure evolves and operational experience accumulates, these monitoring intervals can be refined based on observed traffic pattern characteristics, incident response effectiveness, and cost-benefit analysis of different monitoring frequencies. The key principle remains matching monitoring sensitivity to operational requirements while optimizing resource utilization across your entire monitoring infrastructure.
